## Vehicle Segmentation Project

This project performs vehicle segmentation on a dataset of images. To execute the code, please follow these steps:

1. Download the image dataset from the source link - https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/autorickshaw_detection/
2. Copy the downloaded images into the following two folders respectively:
   * `images_auto`
   * `images_groundTruth`
   
   For representation purposes, we have only included one image in each folder.

3. Run the `main.m` file to execute the code.
